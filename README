# Mini Banking System

A simple command-line banking application that simulates basic banking operations: creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, and checking balances. This project is designed to showcase fundamental programming concepts such as data structures, file handling for data persistence, and business logic.

## Features

- **Create Account**  
  Enter your name and other details to create a new account. Each account gets a unique account number and starts with a zero balance.

- **View Account Information**  
  Check the details of any account by entering its account number: see the owner's name, account number, and current balance.

- **Deposit Money**  
  Add funds to any account. The balance is updated and saved automatically.

- **Withdraw Money**  
  Withdraw funds from an account if sufficient balance is available. The system prevents overdrafts and displays an error if funds are insufficient.

- **List All Accounts**  
  Admin feature to display all registered accounts and their basic information.

- **Data Persistence**  
  All account data is saved in a file (`accounts.dat`). The system loads existing accounts at startup and saves changes after every operation, ensuring your data is never lost.

## Why This Project?

This mini banking system is more than just a simple exercise. It covers essential programming skills that recruiters value:
- **Data Structures:** Learn how to organize and manage data efficiently.
- **File Management:** Implement persistent storage so your data survives program restarts.
- **Business Logic:** Handle real-world scenarios like unique IDs, error checking, and user interaction.
